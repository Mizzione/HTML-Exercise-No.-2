     <h1>Trees</h1><br/>
     <br>
     I think that I shall never see<br/>
    A poem lovely as a tree.<br/>
    <br/> 
    A tree whose hungry mouth is prest<br/>
    Against the earthâ€™s sweet flowing breast;<br/>
    <br/> 
    A tree that looks at God all day,<br/>
    And lifts her leafy arms to pray;<br/>
    <br/> 
    A tree that may in Summer wear<br/>
    A nest of robins in her hair;<br/>
    <br/> 
    Upon whose bosom snow has lain;<br/>
    Who intimately lives with rain.<br/>
    <br/> 
    Poems are made by fools like me,<br/>
    But only God can make a tree.<br/>
